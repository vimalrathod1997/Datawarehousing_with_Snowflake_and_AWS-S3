10. Edit the Trust Relationship of our IAM Role , add the iam::arn provided by snowflake in the Trust Relationship. Refer 'AWS Steps and Commands'
11. Create a File Format. Refer 'Snowflake_Queries'
12. Create a staging area. Refer 'Snowflake_Queries'
13. Copy the data from AWS S3 bucket i.e., our staging area, into the netflix database. Refer 'Snowflake_Queries'
14. Create a Snowpipe to auto ingest the data from staging area. Refer 'Snowflake_Queries'
15. Get the SQS::arn after creation of snowpipe. this arn value would be used to configure event notification of our s3 bucket.Refer 'Snowflake_Queries'
16. Configure event notification in S3 bucket. Refer 'AWS Steps and Commands'
